# Zoo Management API

A scalable Zoo Management API built with FastAPI and GraphQL.

## Features

- FastAPI and GraphQL API endpoints
- MongoDB database with Beanie ODM
- Redis caching
- Nginx load balancing
- Docker containerization
- Encrypted PII data
- Comprehensive test suite

## Scaling Strategy

### Database Scaling
- MongoDB sharding for horizontal scaling
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Caching frequently accessed data in Redis
- Database connection pooling

### API Scaling
- Nginx load balancer for horizontal scaling
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Efficient database queries with pagination
- GraphQL query optimization

### Infrastructure
- Containerized with Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Cloud-native design for GCP deployment
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

2. Start services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

## Performance Considerations

1. Database:
   - Indexed fields for faster queries
   - Sharding for horizontal scaling
   - Caching layer with Redis
   - Regular maintenance and optimization

2. API:
   - Load balancing with Nginx
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization
   - Rate limiting

3. Monitoring:
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Resource utilization
   - Response times
